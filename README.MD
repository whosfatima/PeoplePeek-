# PeoplePeek 👀

A simple JavaScript-based user filtering app.

## 📌 Description

**PeoplePeek** is a lightweight web app that allows users to filter a list of predefined people by their name. As you type a name or part of it, the matching users are displayed dynamically.

This project is perfect for practicing JavaScript array methods like:
- `forEach`
- `filter`
- `includes`
- `toLowerCase`

It also gives you basic hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling.
